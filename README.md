# SubBrightnessAdjuster
Lowers brightness of display's colors. For when the display's brightness at its lowest is still too high.
Unfinished, but using on my laptop running Zorin OS.

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTACT THE GNOME EXTENSION REVIEWER. I SUBMITTED A BROKEN EXTENSION, BUT I HAVE THE WORKING ONE NOW. I NEED TO SUBMIT IT AGAIN.
